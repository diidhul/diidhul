# Hi There !!! 👋

My name alfadhil, you can call me didul. I am currently not employed but enthusiastic about learning new things, particularly programming. Throughout my college sessions, I eagerly embraced every information systems challenge. Despite not using Apple products, I aspire to become an iOS developer. Presently, I am involved in small projects within my village, even if it means facing risks, such as the 'project thank you.' So that's a little bit about me. I hope you'll appreciate me as much as I appreciate all of you.
